# TodoMVC

 A [todomvc](http://todomvc.com) implementation using [mana](//github.com/jkroso/mana). To run it just clone the repo and run `make`

## Todo

* Style: Replace CSS with something sensible. I think its nice to keep the styling out of sight and out of mind while your writing the app's logic but CSS is pretty cryptic and non-modular

* Animation/Interaction: A good way to test this out would be to implement todo list re-ordering by drag and drop
